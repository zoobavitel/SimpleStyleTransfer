This is a simple style transfer program using Pytorch and some pre-made models. I have two versions - one for Pytorch, and one for Tensorflow. 
The Pytorch one is much more customizable than the Tensorflow one, and seems to have a better sense of what the 'style.'
However, the Tensorflow one is much more accurate when it comes to actually transferring that style.
